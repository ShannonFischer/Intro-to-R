I have used RMarkdown in other classes so I was already familiar with it. I chose to create a FAQ for my package as I am still working on my functions. 
I've never really felt that RMarkdown was any easier to use. I prefer regular R scripts, as you can more easily run everything at once. But I do find that RMarkdown
is helpful when working with graphs, as you can see more than one graph at a time. I also suppose its easier to share code and makes it more clear to someone else 
reading your code.
